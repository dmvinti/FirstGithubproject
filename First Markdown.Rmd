This is going to be awesome. I can't wait to send a link to this to my friends on twitter. 

# How many rows and columns?

This is my first line of *R* code

```{r}
# This is a comment. 

# Number of Rows

nrow(mtcars)

# Number of Columns
ncol(mtcars)


```
This data set has `r nrow(mtcars)` rows and `r ncol(mtcars)` columns.

# sumary of the data set

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```

# My first R plot 

```{r}
plot(mtcars$mpg,mtcars$hp,xlab = "Miles per Gallon",ylab = "Horse Power")
```
